## Things that I will probably do on separate branch (big changes to system).
1. Change Node System. (now i have Node class with NodeType, 
but I want to use polymorphism) it is but on a local fork, gonna move stuff from there to here.
2. Change Walker return type and all stuff from java.lang.Object to NMObject.
(better type checking). done that thing now. (this and above will be in a1.0)
3. that's all for now.
